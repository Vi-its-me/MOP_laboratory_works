; Before loading .bin file emulator reads .binf file with the same file name.

; All directives are optional, if you don't need them, delete them.

; set loading address, .bin file will be loaded to this address:
#LOAD_SEGMENT=0500h#
#LOAD_OFFSET=0000h#

; set entry point:
#CS=0500h#	; same as loading segment
#IP=0000h#	; same as loading offset

; set segment registers
#DS=0500h#	; same as loading segment
#ES=0500h#	; same as loading segment

; set stack
#SS=0500h#	; same as loading segment
#SP=FFFEh#	; set to top of loading segment

; set general registers (optional)
#AX=0000h#
#BX=0000h#
#CX=0000h#
#DX=0000h#
#SI=0000h#
